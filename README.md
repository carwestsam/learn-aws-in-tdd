# Learn AWS in TDD

### Introduction

AWS is a good tool for Infrastructure as Code. AWS accually is a group of
services provided by amazon. 

AWS had provided various types of documents and examples, but they are separated
in different services, not a stream like. Which will border new comers to start
up, especially cloudformation. To reduces this gap, this project try to provide 
TDD like checkpoints, let user and learn it step by step, and has a visual
report.
